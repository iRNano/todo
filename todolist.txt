what does it look like?

how do I position and style the elements?
UI design - it doesnt need to look incredible. 

How does it behave?

1) when it app opens:
	a) for the first time - list should be empty
	b) not the first time - list should be loaded if not empty
2) Task entered in input field should be added to my task list group when 'DO IT' is clicked.
3) A task should be deleted if 'delete' button is clicked.
4) A task should be editable when 'edit' button is clicked.
5) When screen is refreshed, app should retain the tasks.
   

What will my code look like?

1) when app opens, it should check sharepreference? -- 
   State value - check shared preference?
2) Task entered in input field should be added to my task list group when 'DO IT' is clicked.
   -define value of input field
   -function gets called by onClick event
3) -function gets called by onClick event
4) -function gets called by onClick event
5) too advanced for me 
   State value - check shared preference?

all but edit button is done as of 9/14/2019

What do I need to test and what can go wrong?

1) input field is not clearing after clicking do-it button - check
2) value of input field is not added to list - check
3) buttons are not working - check
4) delete button does not delete item from localStorage 
   -what should be done?
    remove selected item from itemArray then save to localStorage
   -what are the challenges you've met?
    I dont know how to delete certain item from itemArray
5) it can now edit textentry only problem is it update all items that has same text. LUL - 10/28/2019

    10/29/2019 challenges:
    Edit and button has incorrect loop when deleting/updating array items.

    		for(let i=0; i<itemsArray.length;i++){
			if(itemsArray[i] === item){
				console.log(i);
				console.log(item);
				itemsArray.splice(i, 1);
			}
		}
